day of 10/2
- Group work
  - We've successfully connected the sensor array & LiDAR onto the casing and zip-tied the casing onto the vehicle. 
  - We successfully gathered both LiDAR & Gyro data. 
  - Next steps is gathering LiDAR, Gyro, & GPS data on visable Potholes & Speed bumps
- George
  - Working and testing new filters & algorithms on the LiDAR data to attempt to detect road disturbances. 

week of 9/30 
- Group Work
  - We've reprinted a new casing and we are planning on weight testing on Wednesday during lab, because we will need to drive and test we will be unavailable during lab.
  - We hope that we can zip-tie our sensor array and zip-tie our POTHOLE Detector onto the vehicle to get any data at all. We also plan to do this on Wednesday after our weight tests.
  - After we get data, we will be able to continue writing our algorithms to detect a pothole in the road, however until we get live data we won't be able to do anything else and we will remain behind.




week of 9/23
- Brennan
  - Changing appearance on the webpage
  - Worked on how markers are added to webpage
- Andy
  - Connected Pi connected to AWS DB from Pi. 
  - Working on sending data to DB from Pi.
  - Still messing with GPS, planning on asking Andrew about antennas.
- George
  - Realized issues within filtering through small sets of data.
  - Attempting to existing filter through small sets of data.
  - Running algorithm on Pi testing time it takes to compute.
- Group Work
  - Creating new Prototype for weight testing & data gathering. Hope to have printed by Friday 9/27
